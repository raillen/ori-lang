# Ori — Zed extension

Language support for **Ori** (`.orl`) in [Zed](https://zed.dev).

- Language config (`.orl`, `--` comments, brackets)
- **LSP** via `ori-lsp` on `PATH`

Version **0.3.5** (matches language package).

## Install

### From GitHub Release (recommended)

1. Install Ori so `ori-lsp` is on your `PATH`  
   ([docs/install.md](../../docs/install.md)).
2. Download **`ori-zed-0.3.5.zip`** from  
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/raillen/ori-lang/releases) and extract it.
3. In Zed: command palette → **zed: install dev extension** → select the extracted folder  
   (`ori-zed-0.3.5/`).

Not published to the Zed extension store yet — **dev extension** / release zip only.

### From this monorepo

```text
extensions/zed-ori
```

Zed: **zed: install dev extension** → select that directory.

Or symlink (Linux):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/zed/extensions/installed
ln -sfn /path/to/ori-lang/extensions/zed-ori ~/.local/share/zed/extensions/installed/ori
```

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Build language tools (if not using a release package)
cd compiler
cargo build -p ori-lsp -p ori-driver
export PATH="$PWD/target/debug:$PATH"
```

## Settings

Optional: force stdlib if auto-detect fails (extension sets `ORI_STDLIB_ROOT` when it finds `stdlib/` in the worktree).

## Features / limits

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|

# Freeze and ABI gates (FREEZE-1 / ABI-1)

> **Status (2026-07-19):** **FREEZE-1 closed**; development line is now **`0.4`**.
> **ABI-1 remains in force** — the `0.4` surface work does not change native
> layouts, so `ori-native-abi-1` still holds and its rules below still apply.  
> This file also carries the **1.0 readiness checklist** (merged 2026-07-17 from
> the former `freeze-1-0-readiness.md`; the FREEZE-1/ABI-1 rules were duplicated).

## FREEZE-1 — **CLOSED 2026-07-19** (window ran 2026-07-13 → 2026-07-19)

**Opened:** 2026-07-13  
**Closed:** 2026-07-19 · next line: **`0.4`** (`compiler/Cargo.toml` = `0.4.0`)

**Why now:** the freeze existed to stabilize the S3 surface, and it did its
job — the `0.3.x` series shipped the ARC campaign, the incremental cycle
collector, `ori update`, the CI native-route fix and the silent match-guard
bug fix, with **no** intentional surface break. The queued work is different
in kind: a set of *additive* reading-first surface features decided on
2026-07-19 (`match` as an expression, `if ok(v) =`, `newtype`, or-patterns,
compact `apply`, struct destructuring — see
[`roadmap-maturidade-v0.4-v0.5.md`](roadmap-maturidade-v0.4-v0.5.md) §10).
Those cannot land under a surface freeze, and holding them back no longer
buys stability — it only splits the trunk.

**What the `0.3.x` rules below still bought us (kept as the model for the
next freeze):** every entry in "Not allowed" stayed unviolated for the whole
window.

### `0.4` line rules (in force from 2026-07-19)

- Surface **additions** decided in the roadmap are allowed; each lands with
  spec + book + tests, never syntax-only.
- Surface **removals/renames** still need an explicit decision recorded in
  the roadmap first (the S3 "one canonical form" norm did not relax).
- **ABI-1 is untouched:** breaking `ori-native-abi-1` still requires a
  version bump per the ABI section below.
- Released `0.3.x` binaries keep working; `0.4` programs are not expected to
  compile on `0.3.x` toolchains (that is the point of the new line).

### Scope of the freeze that just closed (kept for the record)

### Scope of freeze (no intentional breaking)

- Language surface S3 (`0.3.x` syntax/semantics)
- Canonical stdlib paths `ori.X` (nested utils/algorithms remain silent compat)
- Package manifests: `ori.proj` / `ori.pkg.toml` (see `manifest-schema.md`)
- Native ABI tag **`ori-native-abi-1`** (spec 19) — treat as stable; bump only for breaks

### Allowed during freeze

- Patch releases (`0.3.x`): bug fixes, docs, diagnostics, tests
- Additive APIs (new stdlib functions, new optional CLI flags)
- Performance and reliability of existing paths

### Not allowed without bumping to `0.4+` and explicit exit

- Breaking language syntax/semantics
- Removing or renaming public `ori.X` APIs
- Changing `ori.proj` / `ori.pkg.toml` required fields incompatibly
- Breaking `ori-native-abi-1` without ABI version bump

### How to exit freeze — **executed 2026-07-19**

1. ~~Decide end date and next version line~~ → closed 2026-07-19, line `0.4`.
2. ~~Document in CHANGELOG~~ → recorded under `[Unreleased]` / `0.4.0`.
3. ~~Update BACKLOG~~ → gate row updated.

Reuse this same 3-step process for any future freeze window.

## ABI-1 — **DONE** (enforcement in force)

With FREEZE-1 open, **ABI-1 is enforced**:

| Gate | Rule |
|------|------|
| Spec | `docs/spec/19-abi.md` is normative for native layouts / mangling / runtime symbols |
| Version | Tag **`ori-native-abi-1`** (`ORI_ABI_VERSION` in `ori-runtime`) |
| Link | `runtime-link.json` `abi_version` must match staged runtime |
| Break | Incompatible layout/symbol change → bump to `ori-native-abi-N`, update cap. 19, re-stage staticlib **and** cdylib |
| Additive | New `ori_*` symbols OK without bump; list in stdlib manifest |

### Enforcement checklist (maintainers)

- [x] Spec 19 published (`ori-native-abi-1`)
- [x] Freeze window open (FREEZE-1)
- [x] CHANGELOG documents ABI-1 in force
- [x] No silent layout changes on `0.3.x` without bump

## Explicitly out of freeze scope (not language work)

- Multi-OS packaging / marketplace / demos — **shelved** until language + docs +
  performance are done (see BACKLOG priority policy)
- Self-host (M4) — last
- C/debug async (LANG-3 wontfix for v1)

## Language-first implementation (pre-1.0 content) — **closed**

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| S3 + inference B | done |
| M1 install path / M2 stdlib / M3 ABI | done |
| STDLIB async + net/fs streams | done |
| LANG-DOC + examples | done |
| LANG-PERF | done (living residual only) |
| LANG-RES | done (reopen on concrete blocker) |
| Active language backlog | see [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) §2 (LANG-MEM wave) |

## Path to **1.0** (not started as a gate)

1.0 is a **maturity** call, not a feature checklist:

1. Keep FREEZE-1 discipline through prolonged `0.3.x` use.
2. Real programs / feedback without prolonged intentional breaking.
3. Install path remains Rust-free for end users (M1).
4. Self-host (M4) is **optional and last** — not required for 1.0 utility.
5. Explicit CHANGELOG entry when declaring 1.0 (or when closing FREEZE-1 into 0.4/1.0).

Until then: ship **0.3.x** packages under freeze.

## Packaging under freeze (Linux)

| Artifact | Role |
|----------|------|
| `ori-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` | Portable tree |
| `ori_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb` | Debian/Ubuntu install (`tools/package_deb.sh`) |

Windows/macOS packages remain deferred (DIST multi-OS).

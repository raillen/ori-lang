## What Ori Is

Ori is a statically typed, reading-first programming language compiled to native
code (AOT), with optional in-process JIT for `ori run`.

*ori* (אוֹרִי) — Hebrew for "my light."

Ori exists to make programming accessible to people who find mainstream languages
hostile — in particular people with ADHD, autism, and dyslexia — **and** as a
serious laboratory for compiler study and AI-assisted programming. It is **not**
a market-competition product. See the [manifesto](00-manifesto.md).

It achieves readability not by being simpler, but by being more honest: every
piece of information the reader needs is visible at the point where it is needed.

## What Ori Optimizes

Ori optimizes for **reading**, not writing.

A program is read many more times than it is written. Ori makes each read cheaper:

| Question | Visible through (S3) |
|---|---|
| Where does this file belong? | `module path` first in every file |
| What type does this value have? | Explicit annotations on bindings and public contracts |
| Can this value be absent? | `optional[T]` |
| Can this operation fail? | `result[T, E]` |
| When is a resource released? | `using` |
| Where does trait behavior come from? | `apply Type` + `use Trait` |
| What went wrong? | Structured diagnostic codes |

---

## Core Design Goals

1. **Explicit over implicit.** If something happens, you can see it in the source.
2. **No surprises.** The reader should predict runtime behavior from syntax alone.
3. **No null.** Absence is modeled as `optional[T]`.
4. **No exceptions as control flow.** Failure is modeled as `result[T, E]`.
5. **Composition over inheritance.** Types are composed with structs, enums, and traits.
6. **Readable diagnostics.** Every error message names what happened, where, and what to do.
7. **One canonical form per concept.** Dual legacy syntax is rejected at the `0.3.0` cut (S3).
8. **Accessible documentation.** Examples are short, syntactically valid, and up to date.

---

## What Ori Is Not

- Ori is not a scripting language. Programs have explicit structure.
- Ori is not a pure functional language. It supports functional patterns.
- Ori is not an object-oriented language. There are no classes or inheritance.
- Ori is not a systems language in the sense of manual memory management.
  Memory is managed automatically through value semantics and automatic reference counting.
- Ori is not a market product competing with industrial languages (see manifesto).

---

## Mental Model (S3)

An Ori program is a set of **modules**.

Each module is a source file. The module path is declared first with `module`.

```ori
module app.inventory

import ori.io = io

public item_count() -> int
    return 42
end
```

### Imports (three forms)

| Intent | Form | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| Selective | `import ori.fs (readText, writeText)` | Names enter the local scope |
| Module alias | `import ori.io = io` | Use `io.print(...)` — **path left, alias right** |
| Whole module | `import ori.io` | Only fully-qualified `ori.io.print(...)` (no implicit alias) |

```ori
module app.api

public import app.inventory = inventory
```

```ori
module app.main

import app.api = api

main()
    const count: int = api.inventory.item_count()
end
```

Block form (multi-import with commas **only** inside the block):

```ori
imports
    ori.fs (read_text, write_text), ori.io = io
    app.users = users
end
```

Removed at `0.3.0` (hard errors): `namespace`, `import path as alias`,
`import path only (…)`, Auk9 order `import alias = path`.

### Visibility

- Top-level declarations are private by default.
- `public` makes a declaration visible to other modules.
- `public import` re-exports; plain `import` does not.
- Accessing a private imported declaration emits `name.private`.

### The common path through Ori code

1. Define data shapes with `struct` and `enum`.
2. Define behavior contracts with `trait`.
3. Attach behavior with `apply Type` + `use Trait` (inline or `slot = freeFn`).
4. Return `optional[T]` when a value may be absent.
5. Return `result[T, E]` when an operation may fail; propagate with `try expr`.
6. Use `using` for deterministic cleanup.
7. Use `check` for programmer assertions.

## Complete Introductory Example

```ori
module app.main

import ori.io = io
import ori.core = core

alias UserResult = result[User, string]

struct User
    name: string
    age: int if it >= 0
end

apply User
    use core.Displayable
        display(self) -> string
            return f"{self.name} ({self.age})"
        end
    end
end

load_user(id: int) -> UserResult
    if id < 0
        return error("invalid id")
    end
    return success(User { name: "Ada", age: 36 })
end

main() -> result[void, string]
    const user: User = try load_user(1)
    io.print(string(user))
    return success()
end
```

### Surface highlights in this example

| Concept | S3 form |
|---------|---------|
| File header | `module app.main` |
| Import alias | `import ori.io = io` |
| No `func` keyword | `load_user(...) -> …` / `main()` |
| Types | `result[User, string]`, brackets not angles |
| Struct literal | `User { name: …, age: … }` |
| Traits | `apply User` + `use Displayable` |
| Propagation | `try load_user(1)` only (`?` removed) |

---

## Surface S3 summary (breaking vs 0.2.x)

| Area | Canonical S3 | Removed |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Header | `module path` | `namespace` |
| Functions | `name(params) -> T` / `=> expr` | declaration `func` |
| Types | `list[T]`, `map[K,V]`, `optional[T]`, `result[T,E]` | `<>`, `of` / `to` forms |
| Generics | `Name[T]`, bounds `for T: Trait` | `where T is`, `func foo<T>` as canonical |
| Control | `elif`, `try expr` | `else if`, postfix `?` |
| Match | `case Variant` / `case Variant(...)` | leading `.` on case variants |
| Literals | `Type { f: v }`, `{ f: v }`, map `{ "k": v }` | `Type(...)`, `.{…}`, guided `(…)` |
| Imports | `path (A)`, `path = alias`, bare `path` | `as`, `only` |
| Traits | `apply Type` + `use Trait` | `implement Trait for Type`, `apply Trait to Type` |
| Closures | `(u) => expr` / `(u) … end` | `do(...)` |
| Rhythm | poetic call, labeled `end if` | nested poetic call |

Migration aid: `ori migrate-syntax`. Full list: `CHANGELOG.md` `[0.3.0]`.

**Not in 0.3.0:** local Nim-style inference (`0.3.1`), pipe `|>` as product goal,
migration of `ori-game` / `ori-imgui`.

## Relationship to Zenith / Auk9

Ori is a new language. Lessons from Zenith informed early design; source is not
compatible with Zenith.

| Historical / lab | Ori S3 |
|---|---|
| Zenith `text` | `string` |
| Zenith / early Ori `apply Trait to Type` | `apply Type` + `use Trait` |
| Early Ori `implement Trait for Type` | same as above |
| Early Ori `namespace` | `module` |
| Early Ori `func f(...)` | `f(...)` |
| Early Ori `list<T>` / `list of T` | `list[T]` |
| Auk9 (lab) surface | absorbed as S3 on Ori; Auk9 is **not** a product |
| Auk9 `import io = ori.io` | Ori uses `import ori.io = io` |
| Auk9 `do(u) =>` | Ori uses `(u) =>` |
| Ranges exclusive | Ori ranges are inclusive (`0..9` = 0–9) |
| `std.*` | `ori.*` |

## What Ori Is

Ori is a statically typed, reading-first programming language compiled to native code.

*ori* (אוֹרִי) — Hebrew for "my light."

Ori exists to make programming accessible to people who find mainstream languages
hostile — in particular people with ADHD, autism, and dyslexia. It achieves this
not by being simpler, but by being more honest: every piece of information the reader
needs is visible at the point where it is needed.

---

## What Ori Optimizes

Ori optimizes for **reading**, not writing.

A program is read many more times than it is written. Ori makes each read cheaper:

- **Where a file belongs** — `namespace` is the first declaration in every file.
- **What each value is** — types are explicit at every binding.
- **Where absence can happen** — `optional<T>` is the only representation of absence.
- **Where failure can happen** — `result<T, E>` is the only representation of recoverable failure.
- **When resources are released** — `using` makes cleanup visible and deterministic.
- **When behavior comes from a trait** — `implement` blocks are explicit and named.

---

## Core Design Goals

1. **Explicit over implicit.** If something happens, you can see it in the source.
2. **No surprises.** The reader should be able to predict runtime behavior from syntax alone.
3. **No null.** Absence is modeled as `optional<T>`.
4. **No exceptions as control flow.** Failure is modeled as `result<T, E>`.
5. **Composition over inheritance.** Types are composed with structs, enums, and traits.
6. **Readable diagnostics.** Every error message names what happened, where, and what to do.
7. **Accessible documentation.** Examples are short, syntactically valid, and always up to date.

## What Ori Is Not

- Ori is not a scripting language. Programs have explicit structure.
- Ori is not a functional language. It supports functional patterns but is not pure.
- Ori is not an object-oriented language. There are no classes or inheritance.
- Ori is not a systems language in the sense of manual memory management.
  Memory is managed automatically through value semantics and automatic reference counting.

---

## Mental Model

An Ori program is a set of **namespaces**.

Each namespace is a source file. The namespace name is declared first.

```ori
namespace app.inventory

import ori.io as io

public func item_count() -> int
    return 42
end
```

Imports create local namespace aliases. A plain import is local to the file.

`public import` re-exports that alias through the current namespace:

```ori
namespace app.api

public import app.inventory as inventory
```

A consumer can then write:

```ori
namespace app.main

import app.api as api

func main()
    const count: int = api.inventory.item_count()
end
```

### Namespaces and Imports

Current compiler behavior:

- Every source file starts with one `namespace` declaration.
- `import app.util` creates the local alias `util`.
- `import app.util as tools` creates the local alias `tools`.
- `import app.util only (parse, render as draw)` brings only those exported
  members into the local file, preserving the origin in the import line.
- `public import app.util as tools` re-exports that alias through the current
  namespace.
- Imports are resolved from namespace-like paths to matching `.orl` files near
  the importing file.
- An import cycle is rejected with `project.circular_import`.
- If a resolved file declares a different namespace, the compiler emits
  `project.namespace_file_mismatch`.
- Known but unfinished standard-library modules are rejected with
  `bind.stdlib_module_unavailable`.
- Unknown `ori.*` modules are rejected with `bind.stdlib_module_unknown`.

Selective imports are intended for files that need only a few names from a
long module path:

```ori
import ori.string only (is_empty, truncate as cut)

func main()
    const empty: bool = is_empty("")
    const label: string = cut("abcdef", 3)
end
```

If two imports introduce the same local name, the compiler emits
`bind.duplicate_alias`. If a selected member does not exist, the compiler emits
`bind.import_member_unknown`.

### Visibility

Current visibility rules:

- Top-level declarations are private by default.
- `public` makes a declaration visible to other namespaces.
- Private declarations remain usable inside the namespace that defines them.
- Accessing a private imported declaration emits `name.private`.
- `public import` re-exports a public alias; plain `import` does not.
- For public functions, parameter names are part of the public API because
  named arguments may use them at call sites.

The common path through Ori code:

1. Define data shapes with `struct` and `enum`.
2. Define behavior contracts with `trait`.
3. Attach behavior with `implement Trait for Type`.
4. Return `optional<T>` when a value may be absent.
5. Return `result<T, E>` when an operation may fail.
6. Use `using` to bind resources that need deterministic cleanup.
7. Use `check` for programmer assertions that must hold.

## Complete Introductory Example

```ori
namespace app.main

import ori.io as io
import ori.core as core

struct User
    name: string
    age: int if it >= 0
end

implement core.Displayable for User
    func display(self) -> string
        return f"{self.name} ({self.age})"
    end
end

func load_user(id: int) -> result<User, string>
    if id < 0
        return error("invalid id")
    end
    return success(User(name: "Ada", age: 36))
end

func main() -> result<void, string>
    const user: User = try load_user(1)
    io.print(string(user))
    return success()
end
```

## Relationship to Zenith

Ori is a new language. It was designed with the lessons of Zenith as its foundation,
but it is not Zenith and is not compatible with Zenith source code.

Key differences from Zenith:

| Zenith | Ori |
|---|---|
| `text` | `string` |
| `apply Trait to Type` | `implement Trait for Type` |
| `func f(mut self)` | `mut func f()` |
| `while true` | `loop` |
| `type Alias = T` | `alias Alias = T` |
| `to_text()` | `string()` builtin (trait method is `display(self)`) |
| `TextRepresentable` | `Displayable` |
| Ranges are exclusive (`0..9` = 0–8) | Ranges are inclusive (`0..9` = 0–9) |
| Anonymous functions use `func` | Anonymous functions use `do` |
| `std.*` stdlib namespace | `ori.*` stdlib namespace |
